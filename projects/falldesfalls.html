          <p><i>Der Fall des Falls: Das Gefangenendilemma (The Case of the Case: The Prisoner's Dilemma)</i> is a
            photographic project that visualizes the theoretical concept of the prisoner's dilemma. A closer examination
            of this thought experiment reveals that it would not be a dilemma if the prisoners trusted each other
            completely. <br> <br>
            The photo series is intended to illustrate the meaning of trust, decision, and dilemma.</p>

          <p> <i>
              <p>The prisoner's dilemma, a well-known thought experiment from game theory, depicts a situation in which
                two
                prisoners must decide between two options (cooperation or defection) independently of each other and
                without
                communication. They are aware that the outcome of their decision depends heavily on the decision of the
                other
                person. The thought experiment demonstrates that the optimal option for both prisoners is the one in
                which
                they trust each other completely and cooperate. Nevertheless, it is probable that they will select the
                option
                that refrains from cooperation, due to a fear of the other party betraying their trust.</p>
              <p>The photographic series depicts two individuals attired in monochromatic suits reminiscent of prison
                garb.
                They engage in what is arguably the most renowned exercise in trust: one individual permits themselves
                to
                fall, while the other catches them. The images raise questions regarding the nature of trust and its
                potential
                consequences. Does trust always result in a dilemma? And what if one person decides not to catch the
                other
                person? What if the case / the fall had several possible scenarios at the same time?</p>
