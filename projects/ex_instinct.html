          <h2>ex-/instinct</h2>
          <h4>2024, installation, joint project with Friedrich Weber</h4>

          <p>The work <i>Ex-/Instinct</i> explores the fine line between curiosity and appropriation, transience and
            protection, life and death. In a performative way, warmth and touch are used as instruments of discovery:
            What can we see? What can we know? What can we experience? The installation works through metaphors: Warmth
            representative of life, touch for exploration and interaction for curiosity. In a fragile structure, we move
            in cyclical processes: Dead organic matter transforms into energy and energy secures life. But is this
            equilibrium disrupted by human activity? What role do intuition, the individual, and responsibility play in
            the context of the sixth global mass extinction?

            <i>The method of the Ex-/Instinct (use of heat through an infrared plate and thermochromic paint) works
              metaphorically by playing with the subject of proximity through touch and warmth as well as also
              transience.
              It is possible to make animals that are already extinct visible for a limited period of time and to
              satisfy curiosity. <br>
              But what can be discovered when the only possible perception is based on seeing images in a limited amount
              of time? <br>
              The ritual of hand-warming at a fireplace-like, electric power source symbolizes the unbalanced energy
              cycle (dead matter transformed into oil, which can be converted into energy). An audio station broadcasts
              scientific facts, philosophical questions, meta-information and situational elements.
              They touch on topics and information about extinction, the animal realm, transience, responsibility,
              science, rituals and perception.
